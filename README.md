Actually we can use snippet in chrome to run these scripts, they're lightweight. But, I feel comfortable using nodemon to run the script every time I save it. 
If you feel the same, you need to change the start script in package.json and refer it to script file you are watching for. It needs manual tweak too for the debugging script.
